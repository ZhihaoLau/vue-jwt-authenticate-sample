First you need to clone this repo recursively, because it needs a submodule [server](https://github.com/ZhihaoLau/nodejs-jwt-authentication-sample) to serve it.

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/ZhihaoLau/vue-jwt-authenticate-sample.git `

If you have clone the repo without `--recursive`, don't worry. You can clone submodule by running: `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

> Some machines don't need to run this, it depends on your git version. [more about submodule](https://github.com/blog/2104-working-with-submodules)
